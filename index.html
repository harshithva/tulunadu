      <h3>THE KAMBALA</h3>
      <p>
        The Kambala season generally starts in November and lasts until March.
        The Kambalas are organized through Kambala samithis (Kambala
        Associations), of which there are currently 18. Over 45 races are held
        annually in coastal Karnataka, including smaller remote villages such as
        Vandaru and Gulvadi.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kambala is traditionally a simple sport which entertains rural people of
        the area.[1] The Kambala racetrack is a slushy paddy field,[2] and the
        buffaloes are driven by a whip-lashing farmer.[3] Traditional Kambala
        was non-competitive, and the pair was run one by one. In modern Kambala,
        the contest generally takes place between two pairs of buffaloes. In
        villages such as Vandaro and Choradi, there is also a ritualistic
        aspect, as farmers race their buffaloes to give thanks for protecting
        them from diseases. Historically, the winning pair of buffaloes was
        rewarded with coconuts and bananas. Today, winning owners earn gold and
        silver coins.[4] Some organising committees award an eight-gram gold
        coin as first prize.[5] In some competitions, cash prizes are awarded.

      <h3>THE YAKSHAGANA</h3>
      <p>
        Yakshagana is one of the most popular folk theatre forms of Karnataka.
        It is noted for its music, colourful costumes, vigorous dance movements,
        subtle expressions and extempore dialogues. Yakshagana has two main
        variations, each of which has many variations: Moodalapaya (the eastern
        form which is popular in north Karnataka) and Paduvalapaya (western
        style also known as coastal Yakshagana). Of the two, the coastal
        Yakshagana is more popular for the great sophistication that it has
        achieved over the years by the efforts of artistes, thinkers and
        researchers. It is more exuberant and refined when compared to all the
        other styles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Paduvalapaya is performed in three coastal districts of
        Karnataka‒Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada. In the region with
        Mangalore at its centre (which includes Mangalore, Sullia, Puttur,
        Sampaaje, Bantwala, Belthangady, Karkala, Kasaragod (Kerala), Kodagu
        etc.) the tenkuthittu or the southern style is dominant. In Udupi
        district (spreading from Udupi to Kundapura and some parts of Uttara
        Kannada district), the badaguthittu or northern style holds sway. The
        extreme northern parts of Uttara Kannada district are known for the
        northern style (badaabadagu tittu). Let us now look at the structure of
        a typical Yakshagana performance. A traditional Yakshagana performance
        spans the period from dusk to dawn. Nowadays ‘limited-time’ Yakshagana
        has become more popular, as most spectators are taken up with busy
        schedules. In such cases, it is a three-to four-hour performance at
        least. Though this constraint on time has cut down many regular
        features, the glory of Yakshagana has not diminished so far. One gets to
        watch the splendour and grandeur of customs, the progression of
        characters and the scenes etched out in detail, in a full-scale
        Yakshagana performed by a mela or troupe. If the theme chosen is a short
        one, another theme is staged after the first. In some cases, three short
        themes may be performed during a single show.

      <h3>KOLA</h3>
      <p>
        The Buta Kola of Karnataka has its origin from the coastal Karnataka
        region or Tulu Nadu. It is a highly stylized dance held in honor of the
        deities worshipped by the Tulu speaking population. The etymology of the
        word buta is derived from the words bhoot of Sanskrit which refers to
        the spirits and free elements. The word kola in Tulu refers to a play or
        a performance. In short, the Buta Kola refers to the dance-worship done
        in honor of the spirits and deities of the Tulu population.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance is done with a lot of fanfare. There are music and
        recitals. The dancers themselves wear an elaborate costume. The recitals
        in old Tulu speak of the origin of the spirit and how it came to be
        known. Thus, these ancient and culturally significant recitals are known
        as paddanas. There are numerous deities and each has its own
        significance. Most of these deities have titles and roles while there
        are ancestral spirits and wild animals too which are worshipped. The
        deity that the Buta Kola pays homage to largely depends on the sect of
        people, their caste or the group. There are family deities, village
        deities and even royal deities of kingdoms.

      <h3>PILI YESA</h3>
      <p>
        Pili Yesa in Tulu "Tiger Masque" is a folk dance unique in coastal
        Karnataka.Hulivēṣa is performed during Navratri to honour the Goddess
        Durga whose favoured animal is the tiger. Mangalore Dasara is one of the
        festivals during which large number of enthusiasts participate in this
        ritual. It was originated in Udupi District of Karnataka and initially
        performed during the Krishna Janmashtami/Mosarukudike and Ganesha
        Chaturthi at Mangalore, Udupi, Moodabidri, Kundapur and many other
        places in Tulu Nadu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, young males form troops of five to ten members or more, which
        will have three to five males painted and costumed to look like tigers,
        and a band called thaase in Tulu with two or three drummers. This troop
        is accompanied by the manager of the group. During Navratri, these
        troops will be roaming the streets of their towns, with the accompanying
        drum beats of their bands. They stop at homes and businesses or on the
        roadsides to perform for about ten minutes after which they collect some
        money from the people who have observed their performance.
